Built as the final project for CSCI 339: Distributed Systems.

A distributed P2P minimal messaging app that uses the Chord protocol for the Distributed Hash Table (DHT).

So far, tested for only two clients (users), and works just fine.

Changed the code a bit to use exclusively local addresses.

Handled sockets/message transmission manually, thinking of changing that.

To do: test for more than two users and revise Chord. Streamline testing.
